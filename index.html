          Dogs (Canis lupus familiaris) are domesticated mammals, not natural
          wild animals. They were originally bred from wolves. They have been
          bred by humans for a long time, and probably were the first animals to
          be domesticated. Today, some dogs are used as pets while others are
          used to help humans do their work. Dogs are popular pets because they
          are usually playful, friendly, and listen well to humans. Thirty
          million dogs in the United States are registered as pets. Dogs eat
          both meat and vegetables, often mixed together and sold in stores as
          dog food. Dogs often have jobs, including police dogs, army dogs,
          service dogs, fire dogs, messenger dogs, hunting dogs, herding dogs,
          or rescue dogs. Dogs are sometimes called "canines," which comes from
          the Latin word for dog - canis. Sometimes people also use "dog" to
          describe other canids, such as wolves. A baby dog is called a pup or
          puppy. A dog is called a puppy until it is about one year old. Dogs
          are sometimes referred to as "man's best friend" because they are kept
          as domestic pets and are usually loyal and like being around humans.

          All dogs are descended from wolves, by domestication and artificial
          selection. This is known because DNA genome analysis has been done to
          discover this. Dogs have been bred by humans. The earliest known
          fossil of a domestic dog is said to be from 31,700 years ago in
          Belgium. Scientists believe that dogs have lived with people for at
          least 30,000 years. In 2013, a study was published that showed that
          the skull and teeth of a canid, dated to 33,000 years ago, had
          characteristics closer to a dog than to a wolf, and the authors
          determined that "this specimen may represent a dog in the very early
          stages of domestication." Other signs of domestication are that
          sometimes, dogs were buried together with humans. Evidence of this is
          a tomb in Bonn, where a man of about 50 years of age, a woman of about
          25 years of age, the remains of a dog, and other artifacts were found.
          Radiocarbon dating showed that the human bones were between 13,300 and
          14,000 years old.
